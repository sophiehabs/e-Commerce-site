## Technical Details

- Responsive design using Flexbox and media queries.
- Custom JavaScript for the shopping cart functionality.

## 2.0 Version

1. Find out how to change the dropdown filter selection automatically, based on selected category in nav bar. Don't think this is possible as I've seen the same issue on other professional e-commerce websites and have spent days researching alternatives.
2. In the context of a large e-commerce store, implement a back-end to manage products dynamically.
3. Implement a checkout.
4. Add a profile sidebar and login for a more personalized shopping experience.
5. Improve overall website design by experimenting with css.
